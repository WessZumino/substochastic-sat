By slowly varying a chain with some known initial quasi-stationary distribution to one with an unknown QSD, SSMC can often remains close to the instantaneous QSD throughout the entire variation. By choosing a final chain which encodes some optimization problem, if this process succeeds it naturally produces the optimum. This technique is a classical analog of and was inspired by the quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm. \r\n\r\n_SSMC was supported in part by Booz Allen Hamilton, NIST, and QuICS._\r\n\r\n---\r\n>Michael Jarret, Stephen Jordan, and Brad Lackey<br>\r\n[Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science](http://quics.umd.edu/)<br>\r\n[University of Maryland, College Park](http://umd.edu/)<br>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://quics.umd.edu/sites/quics.umd.edu/themes/quics/logo.png\" width=\"300px\" align=\"right\">",
